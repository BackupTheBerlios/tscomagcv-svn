\begin{abstract}
  The sat receiver \Comag has an internal HDD and may record to this and play
  from it. It can also handle external storage devices via USB. Recordings are
  managed to special named directories with three management files
  \texttt{meta.dat}, \texttt{rec.cp}, \texttt{rec.bm} and several MPEG
  transport stream files, names \texttt{rec.ts}, \texttt{rec.01},
  \texttt{rec.02} \dots\@\ Only special TS files can be used by the receiver.

\section{The HDD-Organization}
\label{sec:hdd-organization}

The \Comag reads only the first VFAT partition of the HDD or storage
device. This partition type should be FAT32~LBA (0xC) and the filesystem has
to be VFAT. Nevertheless the \Comag does not show long filenames but trunks
all filenames to eight characters.

Records should be done to the root directory and are organized in directories
named \texttt{rec\_\textit{DDDD}} where \texttt{\textit{DDDD}} is a four digit
decimal number. We call these directories \emph{Records}. See
\autoref{sec:records} for more information about.

Note: Sometimes external USB storages may not be recognized. Sometimes it
helps to unplug an replug the USB cable.

\section{The \texttt{rec\_\textit{DDDD}} Directories}
\label{sec:records}

A \emph{Record} is a directory named \texttt{rec\_\textit{XXXX}} with
\texttt{\textit{DDDD}} is a four digit decimal number. Only files at
directories with this naming scheme are recognized by the \Comag to be
playable.

Each Record contains three management files and one or more files with the
transport stream. The management files are:
\begin{labeling}[:]{\texttt{meta.dat}}
\item [\texttt{meta.dat}] This information will be shown in the display and
  the overview but not in the info box or while cutting. It is
  essential. Without this information the record does not work. See
  \autoref{sec:meta.dat-file} for more information about.
\item [\texttt{rec.bm}] This information may be regenerated by the \Comag, if
  it is not there. See \autoref{sec:rec.bm-file} for more information about.
\item [\texttt{rec.cp}] This information may be regenerated by the \Comag, if
  it is not there. See \autoref{sec:rec.cp-file} for more information about.
\end{labeling}

The transport stream is saved at files \texttt{rec.ts}, \texttt{rec.01},
\texttt{rec.02} \dots\@\ Each with a maximum file size of 2.0\,GB\footnote{The
  exact maximum file size seems to be $2\,147\,471\,360\,\textrm{bytes} =
  11\,422\,720 \cdot 188\,\textrm{bytes}$. And the first file, \texttt{rec.ts}
  seems to be even smaller.}. See \autoref{sec:rec.ts-file} for more
information about.

\section{The \texttt{meta.dat} File}
\label{sec:meta.dat-file}

This file is essential for records. If it is missing the \Comag does not
longer recognize the record. The structure of the file is shown in
\autoref{tab:meta.dat-structure}. Column ``Pos.'' shows the hexadecimal
position of the information from the start of the file starting with
00. Column ``Length'' gives the length of the information. A ``Word'' consists
of two bytes with low byte first. A ``Long'' consists of two Word with low
Word first. \emph{Unknown} bytes may have different values. \emph{Fixed} bytes
have always the same value. \emph{Reserved} bytes are fixed bytes with value
0x00.

\paragraph{Note:} Some bytes of the \texttt{meta.dat} are still unknown. We
have to do more experiments to get more information about those:

\begin{labeling}[:]{99-99}
\item[00--04] I was told, that these are not fixed \texttt{05 00 72 6a 07},
  but no informations about other values and meaning are available.
\item[64] This may be the kind of timer (once, daily, weekdaily, weekly,
  \dots). In this case it would not be fixed \texttt{01}!
\end{labeling}
All reserved bytes may also have a unknown meaning. If anyone has different
information about them, please contact.

\section{The \texttt{rec.ts}, \texttt{rec.01}, \texttt{rec.02} \dots Files}
\label{sec:rec.ts-file}

These files are the MPEG transport stream of the record. A normal MPEG
transport stream of the \Comag exists of 5 header packets, video packets of a
single video stream, audio packets of up to two audio streams, private packets
with EPG\footnote{EPG = electronic program guide}, private packets with
VTX\footnote{VTX = video text}, optional private packets with additional AUDIO
streams, e.g., AC3 sound, null packets, PAT\footnote{PAT = program accociation
  table} packets and PMT\footnote{PMT = program map table} packets.

The header, which we call \emph{Comag TS header}, consists of two null
packets, followed by a PMT packet, followed by a PAT packet, followed by one
more PMT packet. Starting with the 513th packet every 512th packet is a null
packet followed by a PAT and a PMT packet. We call this the \emph{Comag TS
  info block}.

The \emph{Comag TS header} and the \emph{Comag TS info block} are essential
for the receiver. If they are missing or broken, the \Comag cannot play the
record an may even hang up.

The complete MPEG transport stream is splitted into files with size less than
2\;GBytes. Only the first starts with a Comag TS header. All others start with
a Comag TS info block. Because of this splitting is only allowed before a
Comag TS info block.


\subsection{General Information about TS}
\label{sec:ts-general}

MPEG transport streams (TS) consists of single packets of 188 octets. An octet
are 8~bits. For building bytes from octets you have to but the first sended
bit of the octet into the highest bit of the byte, the second sendes bit into
the second highest bit of the byte and so on until the 8th sended bit will
stay in the lowest bit of the byte. So a data stream of 10101010 (first sendes
bit is the right most) will become the Byte 0x33. We use bytes in this
documentation!

Many general informations about TS may be found at \cite{iso13818-1},
\cite{iso13818-2}, \cite{iso13818-3}, and \cite{iso13818-4}. The \Comag uses
only some packets. So we describe only them in this document. The general
structure of TS~packets may be found at \autoref{tab:ts-general}.

\paragraph{Additional information to some elements of the TS~packet:}
\setkomafont{descriptionlabel}{\ttfamily}
\begin{description}
\item[sync\_byte] -- In theory the TS does not need to start with a packet and
  one packet does not need to follow a packet. Packets may be recognized by a
  \emph{sync\_byte} byte. But it seams that at the records of the \Comag the
  files consists only of packets and no \emph{garbage} may be found before the
  first packet or between packets.
\item[payload\_unit\_start\_indicator] -- PES or PSI packets may be longer
  than 184~bytes minus the length of an optional adaptation field. At the
  first TS packet of a PES or PSI packet this bit should be 1. If no PES or
  PSI packet starts at the TS packet the bit should be 0.

  For null packets the \texttt{payload\_unit\_start\_indicator} should also be
  0.

  For private data not of \texttt{stream\_type} 5 or 6 the meaning is not
  defined.
\item[transport\_priority] -- Depending on the decoder this bit may be related
  to the PID of the packet or not.
\item[PID] -- An general overview of the PIDs may be found in
  \autoref{tab:PID}. Important for the \Comag are null packets with PID
  0x1fff, that may be Comag info packets, program association table (PAT) with
  PID 0x0000, and audio, videom and program map table (PMT) with PID
  0x0010\dots 0x1ffe.
\item[transport\_scrambling\_control] -- This document does not handle
  scambled data, so this should be 00 at least for private packets, PAT, and
  PMT.
\item[adaptation\_field\_control] -- We split this into \texttt{AF} and
  \texttt{PD}. The first (topmost) bit is \texttt{AF}. If \texttt{AF} was set,
  the \texttt{adaptation\_field} is used and $N$ ist not 0. The second (lower)
  bit is \texttt{PD}. If \texttt{PD} was set, the \texttt{data\_byte[]} array
  has payload data and not only suffing bytes.
\item[continuity\_counter] -- This value is PID dependent. Is increases for
  every packets with the same PID. If two consecutive TS packets have the same
  PID and the same \texttt{continuity\_counter} they are
  duplicates. Duplicates may be send for synchronization purpose.
\item[adaptation\_field] -- The adaptation field may have several data. Most
  interesting are PCR and DTS, that are clock informations. Detailed
  information about the adaptation field may be found at
  \autoref{sec:adaptation-field}.
\item[{data\_byte[]}] -- This array may contain either of stuffing bytes 0xff or
  of payload. Payload is the data of private packets, null packets, PES, PSI.

\subsection{Adaptation Field at Transport Stream Packets}
\label{sec:adaptation-field}

The adaptation field may have several data. Most interesting are PCR and DTS,
that are clock informations. The adaptation field may also used for stuffing
at packets with PES packets. The general structure of adaptation fields may be
found at \autoref{tab:adaptation-field}. The adaptation field is only part of
the TS~packet if the \texttt{AF} is 1.

\paragraph{Additional information to some elements of the adaptation field:}
\setkomafont{descriptionlabel}{\ttfamily}
\begin{description}
\item[adaptation\_field\_length] -- If this is 0x00 no more data follows in
  the adaptation field and the \texttt{adaptation\_field\_length} is a kind of
  single stuffing byte.
\item[discontinuitiy\_indicator] -- If this is not present it is 0. If it is
  1, it indicates a discontinuity either of system time-base or
  \texttt{continuity\_counter}.

  See \cite[section~2.4.3.5]{iso13818-1} for information about system
  time-base discontinuity.

  See \cite[section~2.4.3.5]{iso13818-1} for information about
  \texttt{continuity\_counter} discontinuity.
\item[random\_acess\_indicator] -- See \cite[section~2.4.3.5]{iso13818-1} for
  information about this.
\item[elementary\_stream\_priority\_indicator] -- See
  \cite[section~2.4.3.5]{iso13818-1} for information about this.
\item[PCR\_flag] -- 1 indicates a PCR field at the adaptation field.
\item[OPCR\_flag] -- 1 indicates a OPCR field at the adaptation field.
\item[splicing\_point\_flag] -- 1 indicates a \texttt{splice\_countdown} field
  in the adaptation field.
\item[transport\_private\_data\_flag] -- 1 indicates one or more
  \texttt{transport\_private\_data\_byte} in the adaptation field.
\item[adaptation\_field\_extension\_flag] -- 1 indicates adaptation field
  extensions at the adaptation field.
\item[program\_clock\_reference\_base; program\_clock\_referenc\_extension]
  The program clock reference (PCR) is a 42~bit~value giving the program clock
  in 27~MHz. It is calculated:
  \begin{align}
  \mathrm{PCR} &= 300 \cdot \mathtt{program\_clock\_reference\_base} \notag\\
               &+ \mathtt{program\_clock\_reference\_extension}\,.
  \end{align}
\item[original\_program\_clock\_reference\_base] -- See
  \texttt{program\_clock\_reference\_base}.
\item[original\_program\_clock\_referenc\_extension] -- See
  \texttt{program\_clock\_referenc\_extension}.
\item[splice\_countdown] -- See
  \cite[section~2.4.3.5]{iso13818-1} for information about this.
\item[transport\_private\_data\_length] -- The length of the data at the
  immediate following \texttt{transport\_private\_data\_byte[]}. The data
  itself should not extends beyound the adaptation field. So the
  \texttt{transport\_private\_data\_length} should be at least less than 181
  and even lesser if PCR, OPCR or \texttt{splice\_dountdown} are used.
\item[{transport\_private\_data\_byte[]}] -- The data of this field is no
  specified by IEC.
\item[adaptation\_field\_extension\_length] -- The length of the 
  immediate following data including reserved bytes if pressent.
\item[ltw\_flag] -- 1 indicates \texttt{ltw\_valid} and \texttt{ltw\_offset} at
  the extension.
\item[piecewise\_rate\_flag] -- 1 indicates \texttt{piecewise\_rate} at the
  extension.
\item[seamless\_splice\_flag] -- 1 indicate \texttt{splice\_type},
  \texttt{DTS\_next\_AU} and the \texttt{marker\_bit}s at the extension. Note,
  that it should be 1 only if the \texttt{splicing\_point\_flag} is 1 too.
\item[ltw\_valid\_flag] -- 1 indicates, that the value of \texttt{ltw\_offset}
  is valid. 0 indicates, that the value of \texttt{ltw\_offset} is undefined.
\item[ltw\_offset] -- See
  \cite[section~2.4.3.5]{iso13818-1} for information about this.
\item[piecewise\_rate] -- The value of this is only valid if both
  \texttt{ltw\_flag} and \texttt{ltw\_valid\_flag} are set to 1. See
  \cite[section~2.4.3.5]{iso13818-1} for information about this.
\item[splice\_type] -- See
  \cite[section~2.4.3.5]{iso13818-1} for information about this.
\item[DTS\_next\_AU]  -- 33 bit value of the DTS. 
\item[{stuffing\_data[]}] -- All these bytes are 1111\,1111 (0xff). They are
  used to stuff the TS packet to 188 bytes.

\subsection{Comag TS Header}
\label{sec:comag-ts-header}

The header consists of 5 packets: null packet, null packet, PMT packet, PAT
packet, PMT packet. The second PMT packet is a copy if the first one. The
second null packet consists of payload with stuffing bytes\footnote{Stuffing
  bytes are 0xff.} only. The first null packet is called \emph{Comag info
  packet}. The general structure of this packet is shown in
\autoref{tab:comag-info-packet}. The general structure of this packet is same
in the header and the info block (see \autoref{sec:comag-ts-info-block}). But
some values are valid at only either the header or the info block and 0
otherwise.

\paragraph{Example of the Comag info packet at the header:} This example shows
not only the payload but the whole packet. You have to remove four bytes from
start to get the payload only. \textcolor{unsure}{Unsure} and
\textcolor{unknown}{Unknown} bytes are colored to mark them.

\subsection{Comag TS Info Block}
\label{sec:comag-ts-info-block}

The info block consists of a \emph{Comag info packet} (see
\autoref{tab:comag-info-packet}) followed by PAT and a PMT packet. The Comag
info packet differs from the one in the header. Some values are same, some are
updated and some are 0 always. The PAT and PMT packets are copies of the PAT
and PMT packets from the header (see \autoref{sec:comag-ts-header}).

\paragraph{Example of the Comag info packet at the info block:} This example shows not only the
payload but the whole packet. You have to remove four bytes from start to get
the payload only. \textcolor{unsure}{Unsure} and \textcolor{unknown}{Unknown}
bytes are colored to mark them.

Note, that all not 0 values unless \texttt{elapsed\_time} and
\texttt{unknown\_1} are copies from the Comag info packet at the Comag TS
header. Only \texttt{elapsed\_time} and \texttt{unknown\_1} change from Comag
TS info block to Comag TS info block!


\subsection{Comag info packet}

The Comag info packet is a null packet with special contents. The general
structure is same as Comag TS header (see \autoref{sec:comag-ts-header}) and
Comag TS info block (see \autoref{sec:comag-ts-info-block}). Some values are
only used at the header and 0 at the info block, some are only used at the
info block and 0 at the header, some are updated at every info block and some
are same at header and every info block.

The Comag info packet has not adaptation field but payload. So the first 4
bytes of the packet are \texttt{47 1f ff 10}. The general structure of the
payload may be found at \autoref{tab:comag-info-packet}. Examples are shown at
\autoref{sec:comag-ts-header} and \autoref{sec:comag-ts-info-block}.

\paragraph{Note:} Some bytes of the \texttt{Comag info packet} are still

\begin{labeling}[:]{99-99}
\item[00--04] We don't know if the magic number really consists of 5\,Bytes or
  if some of these bytes have special meanings.
\item[54--57] These bytes seam to be a four byte value, that increases
  rapidly, but we do not know anything about.
\item[a8--ab] These bytes are not 0 and not fixed, but we do not know anything
  about. 
\end{labeling}

\paragraph{Additional information to some elements of the Comag info packet:}
\setkomafont{descriptionlabel}{\ttfamily}
\begin{description}
\item[magic] -- This seams to be always the same.
\item[info\_packets] -- This is the number of Comag info packets at the
  transport stream of the record. If the transport stream consists of more
  than one file, it does not show the number of Comag info packets at the
  current file, but at all files together. It is valid only at the Comag TS
  header and 0 otherwise.
\item[duration] -- This is the duration of the complete transport stream if
  the record that may consists of many files. The value is in milliseconds or
  kHz.  It is valid only at the Comag TS header and 0 otherwise.
\item[streams\_used] -- This is the number of streams, the \Comag used at the
  transport stream. A stream may either be a video, an audio or an EPG or VTX
  stream. Up to 8 streams are possible.
\item[{pid[8]}] -- Array with the PID numbers of the used
  streams. \texttt{streams\_used} values should be not 0, all others should be
  0.
\item[{pid\_type[8]}] -- The types of the PIDs saved at \texttt{pid[8]}. EPG
  streams has the type~0, video streams the type~1, audio streams the type~2,
  and VTX streams the type~4. Other values currently not known.
\item[{stream\_lang[8]}] -- you may simply read/write the three characters of
  the language name from right to left with 4th byte is NUL.
\item[elapsed\_time] -- This is the current duration of the record in
  milliseconds (or kHz). It is 0 at the header and updated at the info blocks.
\item[unknown\_1] -- We really should know more about this but don't. It is 0
  at header and rapidly increasing (with overflow jumps) at the info blocks.
\item[title\_type] -- Currently only the two types are known. Type~8 is used
  by the \Comag at records using EPG. In this case the \texttt{title} is the
  title of the transmission e.g. the movie title. Type~2 is used for records
  using the REC key or a manual timer. In this case the title is the station
  by default and may be changed manually.
\item[title] -- A NUL-terminated string.  Currently only titles with encoding
  ISO-Latin-1 (aka ISO-8859-1) are known.  No explicite encoding information
  known.
\item[stream\_files] -- The \Comag splits streams into portions of less than
  2\,GBytes. The first file is named \texttt{rec.ts}, the next
  \texttt{rec.01}, followed by \texttt{rec.02} and so on. At the header, this
  value is the number of files. At the info blocks it is always 0.

\section{The \texttt{rec.bm} File}
\label{sec:rec.bm-file}

If this file is missing at a record, the receiver recreates an empty
one. The file saves the marks, e.g., for cutting. The already known structure
of that file is shown in \autoref{tab:rec.bm-structure}.

\section{The \texttt{rec.cp} File}
\label{sec:rec.cp-file}

If this file is missing at a record, the receiver recreates an empty
one. Empty files consist of 372 Bytes 0x00. Nothing more about this file is
known, but we think, that the cutting points are saved at this file after
cutting was done.
