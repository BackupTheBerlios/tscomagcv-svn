To produce all essential files for distribution or make process simply call

   make -f Makefile.cvs
   ./configure

If you want to use kdevelop, you may use

   cd <project directory>
   kdevelop kfile_metadat.kdevelop

IMPORTANT: Makefile.cvs adds everything at this directory to the dist-rule!
Becaus of this, the directory should be really distclean before running ``make
-f Makefile.cvs''.
